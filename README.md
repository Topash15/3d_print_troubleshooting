# 3D Assistant

## About
3D Assistant is an interactive website that aims to simplify the process of troubleshooting 3D printers. The user can select the problem that they are having from a list. Once selected, the first step will load. Each step provides instructions for the user to follow. They may include a helpful link or photo as well. If the step does not resolve the problem, the user should select the appropriate response and then next troubleshooting step will appear.
